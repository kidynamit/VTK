/**
 * @class   vtkSimilarityBalls
 * @brief   compute the local maxima in the similarity field and draw a
 * circle of radius around it
 *
 * vtkSimilarityBalls is a filter that takes the similarityData as produced
 * by vtkMomentInvariants. 0. It computes the local maxima in space plus
 * scale and produces the output localMaxSimilarity that contains the
 * similarity value together with the corresponding radius at the maxima.
 * All other points are zero.
 * If a grid is provided in the optional second input, it also produces
 * two output fields for further visualization that encode
 * the radius through drawing
 * 1. a solid ball or
 * 2. a hollow sphere around those places.
 * The second input steers the resolution of the balls. It is helpful if
 * its extent is a multiple of the first input's. Then, the circles are
 * centered nicely. The spheres/circles are good for 2D visualization The
 * balls are good for 3D volume rendering or steering seeding of visualization
 * elements The theory and the algorithm is decribed in Roxana Bujack, Jens
 * Kasten, Ingrid Hotz, Gerik Scheuermann, and Eckhard Hitzer: "Moment
 * Invariants for 2D Flow Fields via Normalization in Detail."
